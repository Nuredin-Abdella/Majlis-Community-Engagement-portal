        <h2>Development</h2>
        <h3>Ethiopian Muslims Development Agency (EMDA)</h3>
        <p>
          EIASC established EMDA as its development wing to alleviate economic and social problems and to promote
          development activities. Since its establishment, EMDA has implemented multidimensional, participatory, and
          need‑based development programs across the country, contributing to maternal and child health in remote
          pastoralist communities (Afar and Somali), women empowerment, poverty reduction, capacity building, and
          environmental rejuvenation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To address the root causes of poverty and uplift living standards of marginalized and vulnerable communities
          based on Islamic values and perspectives, including diverse community voices.
        </p>

        <h4>Strategic Goals</h4>

          <li>Ensure food security for poor and marginalized communities.</li>
          <li>Build adaptation and recovery capacities to climate‑induced shocks and stress.</li>
          <li>Save lives and protect livelihoods during humanitarian crises (drought/conflict).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Organizational Structure (Summary)</h4>
        <p>
          EMDA follows EIASC’s structure, governed by a 44‑member General Assembly and a Board of Management providing
          strategic direction. The Executive Director leads day‑to‑day operations with a management committee, and five
          directorates (Administration & Finance, Partnerships & Resource Mobilization, Planning/Monitoring & Evaluation,
          Public Relations & Documentation, and Programs). Programs cover access to basic services, women & family
          affairs, capacity development, livelihoods & food security, and climate adaptation/DRR/displaced citizens’ rehabilitation.
